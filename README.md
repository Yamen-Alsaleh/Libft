# Libft
*This activity has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by yalsaleh*
This is my version of libft based on 42 standards that I did in my journey in 42Irbid Common Core program (New Curriculum)

# Description
Libft is the first project in the 42 curriculum. Its goal is to reimplement essential C standard library functions from scratch, as well as additional utility functions that will be used in future projects. This project helps you build a strong understanding of memory management, string manipulation, linked lists, and low-level programming.
# Instructions
You can use these commands to compile ans get the library ready or if you want to delete it 
```bash
make        #compile and create the library
make clean  #clean object files
make fclean #remove object files and the library
make re     #recompile everything
```
# Resources
- The C Standard Library manual pages (man 3 <function>)

- Tutorials about pointers and memory management

- Articles discussing implementation details of libc-like functions
## AI Usage
AI was used to:

- Draft documentation structure

- Clarify explanations of functions and concepts

- Format the README in markdown
### AI was not used to write any project code, respecting 42's learning goals.
